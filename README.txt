"Attic" plugin by Stanislau Kurkou (2022)

This plugin was built in Visual Studio (2019) using JUCE library code. "Attic" is a non-linear ladder filter processor, the logic 
of which is loosely based on early model MOOG ladder filter synths. It facilitates the use of the Value Tree State (vts) class from JUCE 
library code and comes with the following user-defined controls:
-'C' for Cutoff.
-'R' for Resonance.
-'D' for Drive.
-Menu which allows the user to switch the mode the plugin is operating in (LP, HP and Band-Pass, with a slope of 12dB or 24dB per octave).

Attic is designed for use as a VST3 plugin. Simply download and add the file path of "Attic.vst3" to the plugins 
folder for your DAW and re-scan. Attic has been tested using Reaper v6.50 (2022).
